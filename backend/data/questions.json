In 3 dimensions the shape is curved and is meant to be better for the user than a regular mouse. A competitor hears about the new design before it is released and decides to copy the company. To avoid it being too obvious that they are copying the design, they change the dimensions of the 2D side-profile of the square to be 1.5 times bigger. They keep the height of the parallelogram the same but change its base so that it still fits perfectly on top of the square.
